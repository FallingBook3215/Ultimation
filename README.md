# Ultimation
Might be a big goal but I plan on basically making a free and open source animation software. This is because the majority of animation tools are difficult to either grasp or even obtain in the first place. This is an issue for a lot of people and me too. My goal is to make an animation software that doesn't require any signing up and doesn't have a price tag too it either.

I'm making this for the web because that's what I do but maybe if this works out then I'll port it in the future. Do keep in mind that as I'm writing this, the project isn't even to the point of release so this will be a long journey that eventually could possibly not even turn up.
